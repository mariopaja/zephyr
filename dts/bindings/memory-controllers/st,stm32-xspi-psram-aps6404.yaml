      Limit a transaction to a boundary of aligned addresses. The size of the
      alignment is given by the value: 2^(csbound) bits.
      A csbound value of 0 means the feature is disabled.
      The default is the minimum recommended value in the Reference Manual. It
      is recommended to set this value according to the length of the burst wrap
      of the PSRAM device for the linear burst command.
